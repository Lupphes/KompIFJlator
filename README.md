A univeristy group project for the [Formal Languages and Compilers](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/13981/.en) course at Faculty of Information Technology at Brno University of Technology. This project was made in the 2020/21 winter semester and was an implementation of a simplified Go compiler.

If you are a future student of the Formal Languages and Compilers course, don't copy the code; it won't end well.
